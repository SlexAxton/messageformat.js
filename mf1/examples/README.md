# Example

`messageformat` may be used in a number of different ways;
this directory includes examples of some of these.

To build all the examples, starting from the root of the repository:

```sh
npm install
npm run build

cd examples/
npm install
npm run build
```

That will produce outputs in each example's `dist/` directory.
See their README files for more information.
